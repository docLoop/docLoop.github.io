			<h3>Ideal Use Case</h3>
			<p>
				Best case scenario is the author working on an open educational resource (<a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_educational_resources">OER</a>) using LaTeX and publishing the source code in an online repository.
			</p>

			<h4>How is this the best case?</h4>

					<h5>Open Educational Resources</h5>
					<p>
						<a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_educational_resources">OER</a> are meant to be shared, forked and to incorporate reader's feedback.
					</p>

				</article>

				<article>
					<h5>Online Annotations</h5>
					<p> 
						Lots of Feedback will made by readers who are not familiar with the authoring tools and cant be expected to learn the ropes of the author's issue tracking system.
					</p>
				</article>

				<article>
					<h5>Online Repository</h5>
					<p> 
						Online Repositories make it easy to share and fork content. Also: They usually come with version control and bug tracking system.
					</p>
				</article>


				<article>
					<h5>LaTeX</h5>
					<p> 
						Having a source code makes it alot easier to fork and update documents. Turning that code into PDFs makes it easy tp annotate!
